In C++, a vector is a data structure that stores a sequence of elements that can be accessed by index.

Unlike arrays, vectors can dynamically shrink and grow in size.

The standard <vector> library provide methods for vector operations:

.push_back(): add element to the end of the vector.
.pop_back(): remove element from the end of the vector.
.size(): return the size of the vector.
.empty(): return whether the vector is empty.
